## Query Parameter vs Body

The reasoning I've always used is that because POST, PUT, and PATCH presumably have payloads containing information that customers might consider proprietary, the best practice is to put all payloads for those methods in the request body, and not in the URL parms, because it's very likely that somewhere, somehow, URL text is being logged by your web server and you don't want customer data getting splattered as plain text into your log filesystem.

That potential exposure via the URL isn't an issue for GET or DELETE or any of the other REST operations.
