## Query Parameter vs Body

> ddd 연습중에 Controller부분을 짜다가 생각이난 부분
난 요청이 오면 Body로 처리하는걸 선호해 대부분 Body로 처리했는데 둘중에 뭐가 나은지 궁금해서 검색해봄.  

The reasoning I've always used is that because POST, PUT, and PATCH presumably have payloads containing information that customers might consider proprietary, the best practice is to put all payloads for those methods in the request body, and not in the URL parms, because it's very likely that somewhere, somehow, URL text is being logged by your web server and you don't want customer data getting splattered as plain text into your log filesystem.

That potential exposure via the URL isn't an issue for GET or DELETE or any of the other REST operations.
